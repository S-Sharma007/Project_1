## Step-by-Step Execution

### 1. **Provisioning Infrastructure with Terraform**
   - Set up Terraform to facilitate infrastructure provisioning.
   - Use Terraform scripts to provision Jenkins master, build nodes, and an Ansible server.

### 2. **Configuring Ansible for Automation**
   - Install and configure Ansible.
   - Use Ansible playbooks to set up Jenkins master and build nodes.

### 3. **Setting up Jenkins for CI/CD**
   - Install Jenkins and create a Jenkins pipeline job.
   - Develop a Jenkinsfile from scratch to define CI/CD stages: build, test, analysis, publish, and deployment.
   - Implement a multibranch pipeline to manage multiple code branches.
   - Enable webhooks on GitHub to trigger automated CI/CD pipelines.

### 4. **Ensuring Code Quality with SonarQube**
   - Configure SonarQube and integrate Sonar scanner into the Jenkins pipeline.
   - Define rules and gates to enforce code quality standards.
   - Set up Sonar callback rules for feedback after analysis.

### 5. **Managing Artifacts with JFrog Artifactory**
   - Configure JFrog Artifactory as an artifact repository.
   - Create Dockerfiles for application containerization.
   - Push Docker images to JFrog Artifactory for storage and retrieval.

### 6. **Deploying Applications on Kubernetes**
   - Use Terraform to provision an AWS Kubernetes cluster.
   - Create and deploy Kubernetes objects using Helm charts.
   - Containerize applications and deploy them in the Kubernetes cluster.

### 7. **Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana**
   - Set up Prometheus and Grafana using Helm charts.
   - Monitor the Kubernetes cluster and applications for performance and availability metrics.
